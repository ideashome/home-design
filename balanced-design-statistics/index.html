<p><strong>Balanced Design Statistics</strong>, Conversely an ANOVA has an unbalanced design if the sample sizes are not equal across all treatment combinations. Refers to a type of experimental design whereby the number of observations or measurements obtained in each experimental condition is equal in some way. With this design every single condition follows another two times and statistical tests allow researchers to analyse the data. The researcher used a balanced design to ensure that he or she had the same amount of data for each group.</p>

<p>The researcher used a balanced design to ensure that he or she had the same amount of data for each group. An ANOVA has a balanced design if the sample sizes are equal across all treatment combinations. This achieves the balance that is described in the title of the procedure. These individuals are separated into two or more treatment populations based on one or more of these characteristics.</p>

<p>In other words we can say that Bose and Shrikhande 1959a 1959b 1960a introduced a general class of incomplete block design which they called pair-wise balanced. A - gender observational factor B - drug experimental factor Factor A has a 2 levels. 157 - Statistical. Pair-wise balanced design is studied by Bose and Shrikhande 1960a. An easy way to test whether your design is orthogonal is to run a correlation of each factors levels using -1 1 level coding against every other factors levels.</p>

<p>So once again if we substitute our sample statistics in place of the population means we get the following as our estimate of the interaction effect for group rc which is Now all we have to do is sum all of these estimates across all R levels of Factor A and all C levels of Factor B and we obtain the following formula for the sum of squares associated with the interaction as a whole. If all correlations are 0 the design is orthogonal. Although many designs satisfy both criteria some such as Central Composite designs forego design balance in favor of data. An easy way to test whether your design is orthogonal is to run a correlation of each factors levels using -1 1 level coding against every other factors levels.
