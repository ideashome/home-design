<p>Biomimicry enables architects to make positive impact on the environment says Michael Pawlyn. In this stunning example of biomimicry the Delfino sonic boat merges inspirations from both dolphins Japanese trains to create a bullet-fast yet super-efficient watercraft. The Humpback whale for example uses bumpy tubercle fins for propulsion which seems rather counterintuitive. The result is a structure that is strong as well as lightweight- and pretty cool-looking to boot.</p>

In this stunning example of biomimicry the Delfino sonic boat merges inspirations from both dolphins Japanese trains to create a bullet-fast yet super-efficient watercraft. This article explores the ways in which biomimicry techniques based on the Design Spiral and Janine Benyus Biomimicry Design Lens Principles of Life can be combined with the design process of an interior design thereby to create a framework with the help of which a designer works and creates a sustainable interior design. 17 Examples Of Biomimicry Designs That Copy The Genius Of Nature Facebook Twitter Pinterest Biomimicry is an approach to innovation that seeks sustainable solutions to human challenges by emulating natures time-tested patterns and strategies.

<p>Some other biomimicry design examples include. Antimicrobial film modeled after sharkskin. Using carpet tiles in a random non-directional pattern mimics a forest floor and instead of having to replace the entire floor the individual tiles can be replaced resulting in lower maintenance costs and less waste.
