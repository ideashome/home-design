<p>The airplane combines a number of configuration features. Configuration E is called an OHS aircraft which stands for Outboard Horizontal Stabilizer. Then consider Configuration D which is an asymmetric design carefully crafted to cancel out undesirable tendency to bank and yaw because of propeller effects or P-effects. An aircrafts wings are some of the most important design considerations with their shape and size affecting virtually every aspect of the aircrafts performance.</p>
