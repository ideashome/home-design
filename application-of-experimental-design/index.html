<p><strong>Application Of Experimental Design</strong>, In a study of two retirement systems involving the 10 UC schools we could ask if the basic unit should be an individual employee a department or a University. If the experiment is designed properly. This review discusses the rigorous experimental design and sample preparation in the context of applying metagenomics in environmental sciences and biotechnology. The experimental design may also identify variables that must be held constant to prevent external uncontrollable factors affecting the results.</p>
