<p>It may involve any combination of stormwater control erosion control and watertable control. Desirable minimum working grade is 02 Typical minimum pipe size is 3 - 4 in humid regions and 5- 6 for organic soils. Farmers and drainage contractors can often decide which subsurface drainage system to use based on some simple on-farm tests. The principle of land drainage design in an Irish context is to exploit the soil layers with relatively high permeability by installing a groundwater drainage system Mulqueen and Gleeson 1982.
