<p>Passive low-pass filter the input signal is passed through a resistor instead of a capacitor like with a high-pass filter. Low-pass filters are commonly used to implement antialias filters in data-acquisition systems. Learn more about low pass filter. The term passive merely means that the low pass filter circuit is constructed without an amplifying element. How it Works.</p>

<p>I am attempting to design a low-pass filter for a subwoofer as the audio amplifier that is connected to it does not filter any of the sound coming in and it is getting pumped full of high frequency sound. Vv_moni The fcuts and mags vector elements are dictated by the filter design what I want the filter to do. When an inductor is placed in series with the power source and a resistor is placed in parallel to that same power source as shown in the diagram circuit above this type of circuit forms a low pass filter. A low-pass filter is a filter that passes signals with a frequency lower than a selected cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency.
