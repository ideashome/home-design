<p>NASA engineers and technologists faced a difficult design challenge based on limited resources onboard a crippled spacecraft. Houston weve had a problem was the first indication that the Apollo 13 mission was in danger. The scenes depicting weightlessness while Apollo 13 is in space were filmed as a combination of practical special effects - with the actors undulating their bodies while sitting on a sprung platform - and onboard the Vomit Comet NASAs plane which could create a brief period of weightlessness by diving steeply. The top diagram shows the details of oxygen tank number 2 and the heater and thermostat unit. Design Brief Pdf Strength Of Materials Truss.</p>
