<p><strong>Aashto Parking Lot Design</strong>, This AASHTO guide provides a comprehensive reference of current practice in the geometric design of transit facilities on streets and highways including local buses express buses and bus rapid transit operating in mixed traffic bus lanes and high-occupancy vehicle lanes as well as bus-only roads within street and freeway environments. Please note The primary objective of parking lot design is to provide safe efficient vehicular access to parking stalls that serve businesses commuter lots and residential facilities. AASHTO Section 1110102 provides guidance on installing guardrail posts. For parking lots open to the general public white is the standard color for parking space markings.</p>

<p>AASHTO Section 1110102 provides guidance on installing guardrail posts. Design methods for concrete parking lot pavements are somewhat empirical and are based on the methods developed for the design of highway pavements that is the Portland Ce-ment Association method Thickness 1984 and the AASH TO design method AASHTO 1993. This standard AASHTO vehicle size is larger than the majority of most cars that are used in the United States. In order to determine parking space sizes the design vehicle size must be defined. Concrete parking lots have many similarities to other types of concrete pavement.</p>
