<p>Block cipher has a specific number of rounds and keys for generating ciphertext. For defining the complexity level of an algorithm few design principles are to be considered. Modern block ciphers typically use a block length of 128 bits or more Examples of block ciphers include DES AES RC6 and IDEA A block cipher breaks message into fixed sized blocks Takes one block plaintext at a time and transform it into another block of. One single clock cycle low latency high clock rates moderate hardware costs encryption and decryption with low overhead.</p>
