<p>Low-velocity ductwork design is very important for energy efficiency in air distribution systems. Where a air cooled to 34C and b air heated to 540C. Low-velocity design will lead to larger duct sizes but it may be worth since doubling of duct diameter. Duct design also needs to take fire stability into. This reduction also improves the air flow characteristics at the branch ducts that are closest to the air-handling unitThe 50 rule is demonstrated in Figure 5 on the next pageNote that at the start of the plenum there is an available air volume of 1200 cfm and an available velocity of 900 ftmin.</p>
