<p>Arch is a curved structure designed to carry loads across a gap mainly by compression. They are self-supporting stabilised by the force of gravity acting on their weight to hold them in compression. The techniques involved in designing and constructing arches have since developed into many other structural forms including vaults arcades and bridges.
